COMPENENTS REQUIRED :
 - Arduino UNO / Mega
 - DHT22 Sensor
 - Red LED (Low Hydration Indicator)
 - Yellow LED (Moderate Hydration Indicator)
 - Green LED (Good Hydration Indicator)
 - 220Ω Resistors (3x for LEDs)
 - Breadboard
 - Jumper Wires


PIN CONNECTIONS :
  DHT22 Sensor Pin Connections:
    - VCC → 5V on Arduino
    - GND → GND on Arduino
    - Data Pin → Pin 2 on Arduino

  LED Pin Connections:
    Red LED:
      - Anode (+) → Pin 5 on Arduino
      - Cathode (–) → GND (with 220Ω resistor)
    Yellow LED:
      - Anode (+) → Pin 6 on Arduino
      - Cathode (–) → GND (with 220Ω resistor)
    Green LED:
      - Anode (+) → Pin 7 on Arduino
      - Cathode (–) → GND (with 220Ω resistor)
